We examine the degree of consensus among participants on the spatial boundaries of their neighborhoods, the stability of participants' subjectively constructed neighborhood definitions, and the overlap between subjectively constructed definitions and census block group and tract definitions. Through an analysis of qualitative interviews, we isolate four factors that appear to influence how participants define their neighborhood boundaries: physical and institutional characteristics of the neighborhood, its class, race, and ethnic composition, perceived criminal threats from within and outside the neighborhood, and symbolic neighborhood identities. These factors can operate to facilitate or compromise consensus and stability about neighborhood boundaries and identity. The study findings are exploratory but suggest several avenues for further investigation into how parents and adolescents construct neighborhood boundaries and the possible influences that subjective neighborhood definitions have on families.},

	abstract = {A probabilistic distribution function has two essential elements: the form of the function and the parameters involved. For example, the joint distribution of an {MRF} is characterized by a Gibbs function with a set of clique potential parameters; and the noise by a zero-mean Gaussian distribution parameterized by a variance. A probability model is incomplete if not all the parameters involved are specified, even if the functional form of the distribution is known. While formulating the forms of objective functions such as the posterior distribution has long been a subject of research in image and vision analysis, estimating the parameters involved has a much shorter history. Generally, it is performed by optimizing a statistical criterion, for example, using existing techniques such as maximum likelihood, coding, pseudo-likelihood, expectation-maximization,or Bayesian estimation. The problem of parameter estimation can have several levels of complexity. The simplest is to estimate the parameters, denoted by θ, of a single {MRF}, F, from the data d, which are due to a clean realization, f, of that {MRF.} Treatments are needed if the data are noisy. When the noise parameters are unknown, they have to be estimated, too, along with the {MRF} parameters. The complexity increases when the given data are due to a realization of more than one {MRF} (e.g., when multiple textures are present in the image data, unsegmented). Since the parameters of an {MRF} have to be estimated from the data, partitioning the data into distinct {MRF’s} becomes a part of the problem. The problem is even more complicated when the number of underlying {MRF’s} is unknown and has to be determined. Furthermore, the order of the neighborhood system and the largest size of the cliques for a Gibbs distribution can also be part of the parameters to be estimated.},

Availability of exact estimates allows an assessment of the performance of simulated annealing and of {MAP} estimation itself in this restricted setting. Unfortunately, the simple network flow algorithm does not extend in any obvious way to multicolour scenes. However, the results of experiments on two-colour images suggest that, in general, simulated annealing, according to practicable `temperature' schedules, can produce poor approximations to the {MAP} estimate to which it converges.},

	abstract = {A number of recent studies have used surveys of neighborhood informants and direct observation of city streets to assess aspects of community life such as collective efficacy, the density of kin networks, and social disorder. Raudenbush and Sampson (1999a) have coined the term “ecometrics” to denote the study of the reliability and validity of such assessments. Random errors of measurement will attenuate the associations between these assessments and key outcomes. To address this problem, some studies have used empirical Bayes methods to reduce such biases, while assuming that neighborhood random effects are statistically independent. In this paper we show that the precision and validity of ecometric measures can be considerably improved by exploiting the spatial dependence of neighborhood social processes within the framework of empirical Bayes shrinkage. We compare three estimators of a neighborhood social process: the ordinary least squares estimator ({OLS)}, an empirical Bayes estimator based on the independence assumption ({EBE)}, and an empirical Bayes estimator that exploits spatial dependence ({EBS).} Under our model assumptions, {EBS} performs better than {EBE} and {OLS} in terms of expected mean squared error loss. The benefits of {EBS} relative to {EBE} and {OLS} depend on the magnitude of spatial dependence, the degree of neighborhood heterogeneity, as well as neighborhood's sample size. A cross-validation study using the original 1995 data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods and a replication of that survey in 2002 show that the empirical benefits of {EBS} approximate those expected under our model assumptions; {EBS} is more internally consistent and temporally stable and demonstrates higher concurrent and predictive validity. A fully Bayes approach has the same properties as does the empirical Bayes approach, but it is preferable when the number of neighborhoods is small.},

	abstract = {Prior studies have separately suggested the importance of physical distance or social distance effects for the creation of neighborhood ties. This project adopts a case study approach and simultaneously tests for propinquity and homophily effects on neighborhood ties by employing a full-network sample from a recently developed New Urbanist neighborhood within a mid-sized southern city. The authors find that physical distance reduces the likelihood of weak or strong ties forming, suggesting the importance of accounting for propinquity when estimating social tie formation. The authors simultaneously find that social distance along wealth reduces the likelihood of weak ties forming. Social distance on life course markers—age, marital status, and the presence of children—reduces the formation of weak ties. Consistent with the systemic model, each additional month of shared residence in the neighborhood increases both weak and strong ties. An important innovation is this study's ability to directly compare the effects of physical distance and social distance, placing them into equivalent units: a 10 percent increase in home value difference is equivalent to a 5.6 percent increase in physical distance.},

	abstract = {Where do neighborhoods come from and why do certain resources and effects--such as social capital and collective efficacy--bundle together in some neighborhoods and not in others? From the Ground Up argues that neighborhood communities emerge from neighbor networks, and shows that these social relations are unique because of particular geographic qualities. Highlighting the linked importance of geography and children to the emergence of neighborhood communities, Rick Grannis models how neighboring progresses through four stages: when geography allows individuals to be conveniently available to one another; when they have passive contacts or unintentional encounters; when they actually initiate contact; and when they engage in activities indicating trust or shared norms and values. Seamlessly integrating discussions of geography, household characteristics, and lifestyle, Grannis demonstrates that neighborhood communities exhibit dynamic processes throughout the different stages. He examines the households that relocate in order to choose their neighbors, the choices of interactions that develop, and the exchange of beliefs and influence that impact neighborhood communities over time. Grannis also introduces and explores two geographic concepts--t-communities and street islands--to capture the subtle features constraining residents' perceptions of their environment and community. Basing findings on thousands of interviews conducted through door-to-door canvassing in the Los Angeles area as well as other neighborhood communities, From the Ground Up reveals the different ways neighborhoods function and why these differences matter.},
