	abstract = {A probabilistic distribution function has two essential elements: the form of the function and the parameters involved. For example, the joint distribution of an {MRF} is characterized by a Gibbs function with a set of clique potential parameters; and the noise by a zero-mean Gaussian distribution parameterized by a variance. A probability model is incomplete if not all the parameters involved are specified, even if the functional form of the distribution is known. While formulating the forms of objective functions such as the posterior distribution has long been a subject of research in image and vision analysis, estimating the parameters involved has a much shorter history. Generally, it is performed by optimizing a statistical criterion, for example, using existing techniques such as maximum likelihood, coding, pseudo-likelihood, expectation-maximization,or Bayesian estimation. The problem of parameter estimation can have several levels of complexity. The simplest is to estimate the parameters, denoted by θ, of a single {MRF}, F, from the data d, which are due to a clean realization, f, of that {MRF.} Treatments are needed if the data are noisy. When the noise parameters are unknown, they have to be estimated, too, along with the {MRF} parameters. The complexity increases when the given data are due to a realization of more than one {MRF} (e.g., when multiple textures are present in the image data, unsegmented). Since the parameters of an {MRF} have to be estimated from the data, partitioning the data into distinct {MRF’s} becomes a part of the problem. The problem is even more complicated when the number of underlying {MRF’s} is unknown and has to be determined. Furthermore, the order of the neighborhood system and the largest size of the cliques for a Gibbs distribution can also be part of the parameters to be estimated.},

	abstract = {In this paper, for a degraded two-colour or binary scene, we show how the image with maximum a posteriori ({MAP)} probability, the {MAP} estimate, can be evaluated exactly using efficient variants of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for finding the maximum flow in a certain capacitated network. Availability of exact estimates allows an assessment of the performance of simulated annealing and of {MAP} estimation itself in this restricted setting. Unfortunately, the simple network flow algorithm does not extend in any obvious way to multicolour scenes. However, the results of experiments on two-colour images suggest that, in general, simulated annealing, according to practicable `temperature' schedules, can produce poor approximations to the {MAP} estimate to which it converges.},
