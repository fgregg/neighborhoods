While sociologists understand that perceptions of neighborhoods affect
the fate of neighborhood residents, we have not had the means to
understand what parts of a city residents would see as a
neighborhood. Using novel measures of neighborhood perception derived
from Internet sources, we can identify the parts of a city that
residents see as forming distinct places. These estimates can be
validated and improved using Structured Support Vector Machine, a
technique for estimating multinomial outcomes under spatial dependence.
