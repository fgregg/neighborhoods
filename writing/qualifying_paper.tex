\section*{Introduction}
Social scientists have collected a wide and sophisticated arsenal of
ways to group similar elements of network. However, except in simplest
cases, what determines the output is the simple, iterative algorithm
of the researcher fiddling with weights until the groupings look how
she wants them to. Our methods to group similar elements depends on us
knowing what similarity means in our network. We usually don't.

When our similarity is binary, i.e. did ego nominate
alter as friend, life is easy. But, as soon as a variable has more
than two possible values then the researcher must decide how to turn
those values into similarities. Different, reasonable choices will
lead to different groupings. A careful researcher may check
her choices for robustness, but may only learn that her errors are
robust. The difficulties grow combinatorially if we decide that
a second, third, or more variable might be of some interest.

In the end, we adjust the various weights until the groupings come out
looking about right. We would have been better off just drawing what
we wanted in the first place.

We would be better off because we humans are all too good at
apprehending an assortment of things as a group than we are at
assigning importance to variables by manually assigning weights, which
we are very, very bad at.

While the interestingness of apprehended unities may vary 
unfairly between individual sociologists (not every one has Weberian gift),
we are professionally required to be interested in the way that a
collection of people groups themselves.

If we can collect information on how people group themselves, then we
can learn what counts for similarity for these people. Understanding
what similarity means for is not only scientifically interesting in
itself, it will also allow for principles prediction of how similar
collections of people will group themselves.

In this paper I discuss how to do learn about similarity using the
case of city neighborhoods.

\section*{Results}
So much for theory, let's see how this works in practice. Let's take
the case of Chicago neighborhoods.  

\subsection*{Data}

I have a nightly updated database of geocoded Craigslist apartment
rentals, sublet, and roommate listings. For most of these listings,
the poster entered some text in a ``Specific Location'' field. With
some minimal pre-processing, we can use these data as observations of
claims that geographical points are in some neighborhood.

Using kernel density estimation, we can use this point data to
estimate a continuous probability distributions that any point in the
city will be claimed to be in any of the neighborhoods (Figure
\ref{fig:KDE}). The gray lines indicate the best guess about the
neighborhood boundaries.

\end{figure}

Using information about the location of rivers, railroad embankments,
highways, and major streets, we can smooth this estimate.

\end{figure}

I would like to treat this measure as a kind of `averaged neighborhood
perception.' Of course, it's biased measure of that. There are
enormous selection effects, but perhaps more troublesome is that
listers are likely to choose neighborhood claims strategically in
order to make a listing maximally desirable. I have been looking for
scientific samples of neighborhood perception that I can compare
against so as to get a sense of magnitude of the biases.

However, I think it's possible that these data, with their biases
might be good enough, and we'll have ways of checking that. 

In addition to these data about neighborhood perception, we also have
block level census data as well as a trove of unaggregated data from
the City of Chicago on the built environment, crimes, 311 reports,
zoning, and the similar. We'd like to set them in relation to each
other.
