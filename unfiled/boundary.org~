Has work on predicting adjacency network from distance matrix using a
model he calls Bernoulli Spatial Graphs, basically the edges are
independent conditional on a distance function between
vertices. Pretty interesting, not clearly relevant for this project.

* Notes
** Predictions
*** T-communities will be more homogeneous
Rick Grannis
*** Segregation is inversely correlated with average income
*** Immigrants tend to live near each other
- Chain migration


*** Spatial Assimiliation Model
- education -> increased racial integration
- occupational prestige -> increased racial integration
- income -> increased racial integration
( seems to hold for "phenotypically white Hispanics and Asian")
- p. 170 Charles

*** Place stratification mode
- constrained options, due to prejudice and discrimination

*** Blacks are much more segregated than nay other group
- Charles 171

*** Hispanics less so, and Asians even less

*** "Black homeowners reside in more segregated neighborhoods than black renters
- Charles 179

*** Exposure 

*** Nation of origin effects
- Irish, Italian, and polish whites live in poorer neighborhoods
- Caribbeans do better than native born blacks


*** In group-preferences leads to clustering
- Whites don't want to live near blacks

*** Housing market discrimination
- Multiple Listing Service will be predictive

*** Schools and Parishes

** Natural areas
*** Lee & Campbell 
Four definitions of neighborhoods
- territorial
- social
- egocentric
- institutional

In 1988 survey in Nashville, TN
| territorial/egocentric        | 32.3 |
| territorial/egocentric/social | 16.5 |
| territorial                   | 16.1 |
| territorial/social            | 12.6 |
| social                        | 5.5  | 

Definition correlated with demographic statuses. Rich, educated,
young, white people most likely to see it as territorial. Older, less
educationed, nonwhites to have a social component.

Similar story with percieved size of neighborhood. 

  
- violence may organize turf and produce homeogeneity




** Craiglists Maps
*** Note: <2011-04-29 Fri>
The three scripts to a) stuff CL rss files in a database, b) extract
listings from the rss files, and c) extract places, geocode those
places, and associate with labels in the listings are functional and
operating.

Areas for improvement
- factor out mysqldb connectivity
- currently the label tables associates a listing, a location, and a
  label. It would be be much better if the table associated a listing
  with the place name that we extracted (dirty_location). This is in
  fact what the real listing does, and we don't want to have update
  the label table if we get better at resolving dirty_locations to
  canonical_locations.
- we should create an auto_incremented ID instead of uniquely
  identifying url resource, it would make it easier select ranges of
  listings
- we have some primary keys set as integers that are probably too
  small for this data (i.e., someday we may have more than 99999
  listings.)
