Social scientists often face limits in investigation of social,
spatial processes because they can only use data that has been
aggregated to into large, geographic areas with boundaries not of
their choosing, such as census blocks or postal zipcodes. Such
aggregations constrain our ability to make reliable inferences about
spatial processes within the given areal unit, and introduce
substantial error if we try to combine data with different boundary
definitions like different decennial Censuses or zipcode and Census
tract data. The ideal solution to the problems caused by aggregated
data is to use unagreggated, individual-level data instead, but this
is often not possible because the disaggregated data no longer exits,
it is too expensive, or for reasons of privacy. However, when it may
not be feasible to use unaggreagated data, recent advances in spatial
statistics, the accumulation of accurate digital maps, and the problem
of ecological inference have likely made it possible to statistically
disaggregate geographically referenced data to a level where many of
the current challenges dissappear. If we dissagregated the outcoming
2010 Census data, we would dramitcally demonstrate this possibility
and produce a dataset that would be used by thousands of researchers
over the next ten years.

In order to a census tract, we need some outside information about how
we should expect the population to be distributed within the
tract. For example, if we had a map of building footprints, we would
do very well to allocate the population only to the parts of the
census tract where a building existed and not to parks, lakes, or
cemeteries. Unfortunately, while such an allocation is substantially
more accurate than a uniform distribution of population over a tract,
there are a infinite number of ways that you could allocate the
population of the census tract to the building footprints. Finding the
best allocation ends up being the ecological inference problem, a
classically hard problem.

However, recent work on the ecological inference problem by Kosuke
Imai, Ying Lu, and Aaron Strauss seems to indicate that if we can
develop prior beliefs about the individual level distributions, then
good inferences are possible. We can develop good priors for census
data. We have individual-level data from the Public-Use Microdata
samples and the American Housing Survey. For many municipalities, we
can acquire tax maps that showed property boundaries and include
information about the valuation, size and number of floors of
buildings. We have street maps and maps of how realtors partition a
city, and school districts areas, and parish boundaries, and on and on.

We also have over a hundred years of theory about the social processes
that drive spatial distribution of individuals and groups, spread over
sociology, urban geography, and land value economics. For example,
with regards to racial segregation, sociology has three big theories
that should predict different patterns of racial clustering. First,
that cost of housing is spatially correlated, people live in the
most expensive housing they can afford, and since wealth and race are
correlated, different races live in different areas. Second,
individuals have some level of preference to live amongst those of the
same race as themselves, all else being equal. Third, search processes
produce segregation either through chain-migration, where knowledge of
opportunites for housing is determined by one's already segregation
social network, or realtors subtly or not so subtly steer potential
renters and home-owners towards one area or another.

While having disjoint theories makes for exciting polemic, it also
might make for better prediction if they make unique predctions with a
blended model.  The hierarchically  nested structure of the Census
data affords us the opportunity to train and validate our predictions.
