Social scientists can often only access data aggregated into large,
geographic areas with boundaries not of the scientists choosing, such
as census blocks or postal zipcodes. Such aggregations limit our
ability to make reliable inferences about spatial processes within the
given areal unit; the combination of datasets with different boundary
defintions; or even about changes over time, if boundaries change. The
ideal solution to the problems caused by aggregated data is to use
unagreggated, individual-level data instead, but this is often not
possible because the data does not exist, it is too expensive, or for
reasons of privacy. However, when it may not be feasible to use
unaggreagated data, recent advances in spatial statistics, the
accumulation of accurate digital maps, and the problem of ecological
inference have likely made it possible to statistically disaggregate
georgraphically referenced data to a level where many of the current
challenges dissappear.
