Sociology is a discipline of latent variables. We never directly
observe a class, a political party, an organization, but only behavior
or traces of behavior that we believe to be expression of a hidden
principle. In this sociology is no different than any empirical
science. But unlike some sciences, sociology has had a hard time
finding ways to measure our most important latent variables so
that we believe these measurements to be reliable and valid.

While most sciences can be mainly concerned with accurately and
reliably measuring attributes of things, in the social sciences, we
must also put together the things that we want to measure like
markets, neighborhoods, or occupations. At our most innocent, we
face the danger of the fallacy of composition, and more commonly and
devastatingly we unintentionally gerrymander the world into the forms
we expected to see. While we have compiled wisdom about avoiding the
most common ways of fooling ourselves, we have little positive art on
how to collect observations together into reliable and valid sets.

Since, the development of Item Response Theory in the 1950s, we have
known how to combine many noisy, imprecise measurements in a
principled way to produce a accurate, precise estimates of a latent
trait of a unit. Strangely, we have never adapted these techniques for
the creation of units. For example, we might believe that an ethnic
group can organize friendships, marriages, consumption patterns,
political behavior, names, and self-understanding. But when we study
ethnic groups as things, we typically only use one, maybe two
criterion, which we do not believe to be all that accurate, to sort
people into groups with hard boundaries even though we think that
these groups could overlap and even nest.

We can do better. In this work, I will demonstrate how we can create
valid and reliable definitions of neighborhoods in a host of American
cities, by combining a variety observations that we believe to be
organized by neighborhoods: labeling by residents, foreclosure rates,
crime rates, and census data. Each of these types of data, when used
singly, would produce implausible neighborhood definitions, but in
combination should gain confidence that we are capturing something
beyond random variation and biases in the data. However, while this
work will produce neighborhood definitions that should be of the
greatest interest to urban sociologists, the method is applicable to
creating defensible definitions of many sociological units.
