In their programmatic article on "Ecometrics," Stephen Raudenbush and
Robert Sampson describe how scientists could construct valid measures
of the properties of ecological areas, but are silent as to how we
might identify ecological areas in the first place.[fn:eco] In their
Project of Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, they allow that
own their effort to define "ecologically meaningful" zones, were not
fully successful; that their neighborhood clusters likely introduced
measurement error because of "inexact correspondence between the
neighborhood boundaries imposed by the census geography and the
ecological properties that shape social interaction."[fn:crimin]

Raudenbush and his co-authors have attempted to either mitigate this
error by including spatial autocorrelation or avoid it by
disaggregating neighborhood clusters into much smaller geographic
units. However, this second strategy runs the risk of providing the
right answer to the wrong question.

By studying smaller geographic units, we can avoid the fallacy of
assuming that the properties of an aggregate describe the properties
of the elements. Unfortunately, by simply dissagregating, we run the
risk of committing the complementary fallacy of expecting that the
properties of the elements will describe the properties of a
whole. Concretely, if the block is smaller than an ecological area,
then even perfect measurement of the effect of collective efficacy on
crime rates at the block level cannot tell us about how /ecological/
properties shape social interaction if we do not know how to combine
blocks together into the right ecological zones.[fn:mountain]

[fn:mountain] This assumes that 'ecological areas' are more than a
convenient abstraction, such as defining a mountain as anything taller
1,000 feet above sea level. If, in reality, properties of locations
and processes are continuously distributed across space then it is
completely appropriate to use the smallest geographic unit that admits
analysis.

If we cannot avoid the problem of defining ecologial areas by changing
the unit of analysis or purely statistical means, it seems to me that
we have three alternatives. We can deduce an ecological area from
theory, we can use local understanding of neighborhood areas and
boundaries, and we can infer the existence of an area from its
effects.

At least in my far from comprehensive reading, Rick Grannis has the
most developed theoretical account of when we shoud expect a
geographical area to be a zone such that the properties of the area
shape social interaction.[fn:grannis] However, he mainly helps us
exclude the geographic areas we should expect /not/ to be ecological
zones.  I hope it does not do too much violence to say that his stage
model identifies necessary but not sufficient conditions for
'neighboring' in geographic areas.

Since we are often interested in how people's perceptions of a
neighborhood shape what happens in that neighborhood, it seems very
reasonable to let people define the geographic areas that we treat as
a neighborhood. Unfortunately, attempts at this approach have run into
two recurrent obstacles to defining a coherent neighborhood area from
peoples perceptions. First, people tend to think about 'their
neighborhood' as meaning a very local area, often not extending much
beyond their face block. Second, when prompted to define the larger
neighborhood area people typically are able to identify one or two
boundaries but often are able to present the researcher with complete
separation of the neighborhood area from surrounding neighborhoods.

However, while people are often themselves uncertain and can disagree
about the areal definiton of their neighborhood, they are often able
to say they live in some defined neighborhood. If we had sufficent
data about the what neighborhood a person in a particular place
thought they lived in, we may be able to combine this data with
Grannis's theory of neighboring to impute phenominologially real
neighborhood areas. I have been collecting data that could be used
for this purpose for a few months from Craigslist rental, sublet, and
roommate postings, and these data look very promising.

Finally, we might attempt to find ecological areas by looking for their
effects. If we believed that the ecological attributes, say collective
efficacy, of an area have an effect on a murder rate, and we believed
that the ecological properties did not vary continuously over space we
should expect to see see patterned differences in crime rates along
borders of an ecological area. As a first approximation, we could
model a murder rate without a predictor for neighborhood area but
which did include local spatial dependency, and map the residuals to
see if there are patterns of adjacent positive or negative residuals.

Such an approach runs the danger of turning the definition of
ecological areas into whatever most partitions the variance in a
particular data set, but we may build confidence that we have found a
real ecological areas if a.) the same spatial patterning of
differences in outcomes emerges from a wide range of outcome
variables, b.) the patterns align with our theories of neighboring,
and c.) differences between spaces match whether individuals think
spaces are different.
