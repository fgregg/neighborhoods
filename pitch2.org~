The fundamental methodological problem of the neighborhood effects
literature is the fundamental methodological problem of sociological
inquiry: knowing what to study. Our claims about neighborhoods depend
upon what parts of the world we identify as a neighborhood. Unless we
believe we carve at the joints, then we should not believe that we are
estimating anything beyond our own butchery. The same is true of our
analyses of class, party, and status group.

As a discipline, we have learned that we can be terribly mislead if we
take group level associations as evidence about individuals. We know
that if observe that counties with high percentages of Catholic voters
tended to have higher rates of membership in the Klu Klux Klan, that
does not mean that in 1930s Klan drew its support from
Catholics. However, we have not really accepted the complementary
danger of being misled about the group level properties because of how
we have aggregated individuals together.

From practical politics, we know that we \emph{can} gerrymander the
world to produce aggregations with arbitrary properties, and if we see
a researcher going through convolutions to define what does and does
not belong to their case, we grow suspicious. However, we tend to not
expend much effort convincing ourselves of the validity of what a
scholar has decided to include in her study of organizations, parties,
or social movements.

In part, this is because we have not developed an art or science for
evaluating the validity of social aggregations. This paper makes a
start on that road by describing how we might identify valid
neighborhoods.
