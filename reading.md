Scenes in Chicago for the G Trees and Real Violins 

This has the classics but is very light on anything for decades.

I don’t know how much of these other things you have read. You have taken courses and taught a course in the college with fellow students in this general area for years.

And Don't know how this fits with your general thinking and don’t want to hold up progress, but here are some normal items in the general area. Glad to chat or you can drop these/ revise depending on how you want to focus, contingent on your other sp field (or is it methods?)  and PhD plans.

More generally if you continue as your are doing origin work in this area, you will be hit by all manner of questions not narrowly “ecological” but more general urban policy. I have barfly move out to these below, but esp. away from Chicago ‘ecology’  in the classics you list are not number one on most urbanists minds. they are general background for far more recent work.  You have a few items in the last section that is new, but it is more methodological.

the gap I see in the paper for tomorrow is the white ethnic Chicago tradition, classically seen as the main driver of policy and politics, with its ethic parades and festivals, jobs and contracts, parishes, etc.   as summarized in many places such as reviewed in:. 

Irish Ethic:

The most recent lit discussions I have seen are in drafts from Chris Graziul. He keeps reading and finding new items, and comments on them in a PhD chapter / draft.  What if we ask him to send you latest for review? He stresses that conscious choice has entered more explicitly in recent work.

Big gaps:

the Stanford Berkeley organizational thrust re ecology.

the Brian Berry old tradition of factorial ecology etc, then his critical reassessment and empirical paper showing that the models explained less every decade from the 1880s or so to 1960s in Chicago, testing the same main factors as in your classic readings, individually and R2 low by the end.
in Berry and Horton, Geographic Perspectives, 1970, not listed in T of C clearly but look for this set of regressions. about 10 page section in the reader. 

He and many others took this as a sign than culture and politics were largely omitted in the old tradition, and went on to add them or break with the whole approach.

Adding meaning, values, culture and politics began with Firey in your readings but was heightened by others from WL Warner at Chicago urban work and  more below. The Dick Simpson, Dennis Judd, ed. The City Revisited, summarizing the debates of the NY and LA urban approaches.  The paper there by Halle and Beveridge is a simple version updating B. Berry on the decline of the classic variables. More detail maybe here?

I think this is better:    2011 “Commonalities and Contrasts in the Development of Major United States Urban Areas:
A Spatial and Temporal Analysis from 1910 to 2000.” Andrew A. Beveridge. In Myron
P. Guttman, Glenn D. Deane, Emily R. Merchant and Kenneth M. Sylvester (eds.)
Navigating Time and   and Space in Population Studies, Springer for the International Union
for the Scientific Study of Population, pp. 185-2  


Clifford Geertz has a broader cultural interpretation of ecology in “Agricultural Involution” apex title, short first section of the book


Fischer, Claude. 1995. “The Subcultural Theory of Urbanism: A Twentieth-Year Assessment.”  American Journal of Sociology 101: 543-577.

The empirical urban work by Dudley Duncan and D. Bogue after the 1950s leads more into your current empirical work.  

The new work by geographers and sociologists in the last decade or so on local area effects is huge industry now that you should touch on at least.  We had a national conference by kk key participants you may have heard about, now posted on the Urban Network:


Sampson, Robert J., Jeffrey D. Morenoff and Thomas Gannon-Rowley.  2002.  "Assessing Neighborhood Effects: Social Processes and New Directions in Research."  Annual Review of Sociology 28:443-478. 

I think there is a later version in Annual Review coauthored with Mario Small.

the Mario Small paper on Chicago maybe 5 years back, and how it is an outlier which can still be incorporated into broader analysis if one handles properly. Big debates over the is on ComUrban.

US/Canada Scenes book, November  2012 - Feb 2014 drafta:

Big theme is what drives urban growth?  the classic ideas of competition and succession did not include explicit policy or conscious innovation. But after culture and politics came the idea of innovatoin/ creative cities, etc which dominates much of the world policy discussion today. A synthesis is in the Handbook of Creative Cities, Elgar

Forest,

Good job on the paper and Workshop. I should have complimented you on the modeling, which is innovative and shows long hard background work. With this setup and the big original data from  Craigs, it is apple pie to merge with stuff like we have for all US zip codes (or sometimes other units like counties for a few variables) in the first two files.

the last two are excel and spss versions of Yellow Pages downloaded data for points defined by longitude and latitude so you can merge with other point files for ARCGIS or  aggregate up to blocks of zips.  We already did this for most?  maybe all of these in the first two files, not to blocks but to zip codes, zictas.

We have lots more, but these are pretty big for starters to give you a flavor of what is quickly available to merge.

there is no one Codebook, alas, as these come from many sources. The most efficient is to create a section on a hard drive where can load  lots of our past staff memos that created many variables and their syntax to do so, then you can search by variable name.  We have some of these past files on Dropbox I can share with you if you want to download e.g.  Chris Graziul’s files or James Murdoch’s, but this is less than 10 of all var names, so  the most efficient is to copy off a little hard drive that I carry with me every Wed, in Windows or Mac format,  120gb aprx.

maybe half the vars are Census and Yellow Page data that are clear with no documentation, so you can see today what they include.

I  recommend never throwing away good data that will legitimately increase your N, so I would retain the whole US and  merge  your files with Craigs. Then you can run both pairwise and listwise and do Heckman like comparisons of how much relations change if you run just Chicago, just your 30+ cities, the whole US, or selected subsets.   Then we don’t need to comment on a debate between Sampson and Small, but can contribute original results to it. This is still a hot issue as so many students esp here are studying Chicago but have no idea how it compares. 

We have 7 monographs and many papers on Scenes discussing variables and results., The methods background is in the Science of Scenes chapter coauthored with Chris G and Dan S, in the Silver Clark book, Scenes, that you might like as an intro to these data.  I am not sure I sent  link to the 2014 draft in my comments for the Sp Field. The 2012 version has graphics pasted so it is easier to read.  But for the Sci of Scences chapter we changed a lot for 2014, so I would try to read that, the LAST address just below:

I am advising  Forest on PhD readings. You mentioned your chapter in the Judd Simpson book was elaborated in a manner more parallel to the Brian Berry full 20th century by decade in another paper. I am looking on your vita for the reference. I seems to be: 

 2011 “Commonalities and Contrasts in the Development of Major United States Urban Areas:
A Spatial and Temporal Analysis from 1910 to 2000.” Andrew A. Beveridge. In Myron
P. Guttman, Glenn D. Deane, Emily R. Merchant and Kenneth M. Sylvester (eds.)
Navigating Time and  and Space in Population Studies, Springer for the International Union
for the Scientific Study of Population, pp. 185-216.

Is this correct? Might you have an electronic copy posted on a site somewhere?

Thanks much!
